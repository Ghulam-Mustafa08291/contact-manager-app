in my contact manager database

users table:
has id,email,name and password


->each contact profile has first_name,last_name,title,email addresses(labelled by work,home etc) and phone numbers (labelled by home,work etc)

contact table:
has id,first_name,last_name,title,user_id

email_address table:
has id,email,label,contact_id

phone_number table:
has id,label,number,contact_id

i think through the help of contact table,we find the contacts of a user,and then useing the id in contact table,we find
the phone_numbers and emails of a particular contact.
